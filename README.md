# Project 3 - Recipi

## Name
Recipi

## Collaborators
Aliff and Lemuel

## Overview
* The app is a recipe app which the user can upload their recipes.
* User and recipe information is stored on MongoDb.
* Recipes can be created, edited, and deleted.
* There is user authentication whereby a user will each have their own account and see what recipes they have added and make any changes if they would like to. 

## Chanllenges
* The most challenging part of this project was setting up the user sessions for authorization. 
* Linking each recipe created to the user in the database was also quite challenge. 

## Technology in Use
* MERN Stack (MongoDB,Express,React, and Node.js


## Notes For the Future
* Make the app more personalized to the user, maybe add a feature where they can favorite their most liked recipes.
* Pull recipes from online maybe using API.
